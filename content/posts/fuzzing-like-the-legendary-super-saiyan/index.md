Many people asked me to do this talk. So now i did it and of you missed it shame on you!

I'm joking, you can read here an introduction to fuzzers showing strengths and weakness of this approach in automatic bug detection.
In particular the talk is focus into the usage and the internals of one of the most popular fuzzers of this time: American Fuzzy Lop.
You will read not only how to use it but also some useful strategies that can be applied to specified classes of programs to improve the performance of AFL.
